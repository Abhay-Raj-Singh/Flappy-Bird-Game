Flappy Bird With JavaScript

Flappy Bird is a side-scrolling mobile game featuring 2D retro style graphics. 
The objective was to direct a flying bird, named "Faby", who moves continuously to the right, 
between sets of obstacles-like pipes. If the player touches the pipes, they lose. Faby briefly flaps 
upward each time that the player taps the screen; if the screen is not tapped, Faby falls because of gravity; 
each pair of pipes that he navigates between earns the player a single point, with medals awarded for the score at the end of the game. 

There is no variation or evolution in gameplay throughout the game, as the pipes always have the same gap 
between them and there is no end to the running track, having only the flap and ding sounds and the rising score as rewards.
